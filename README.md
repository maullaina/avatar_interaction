We noticed that the video of the first scene does work in one of our computers but not another computer.

The video to be shown is in "Assets/1/video/Nuevo proyecto.avi" and, if the previous happens, it should be put again into the "Video Clip" field of the component "Video Player" of the TV's screen.
